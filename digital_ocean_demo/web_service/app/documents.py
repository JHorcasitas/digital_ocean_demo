    "Science, Tech, Math ›Science Chemical & Physical Changes Understanding Changes in Matter Share Flipboard Email Print A bottle breaking is an example of a physical change . Kolbz / Getty Imagesby Anne Marie Helmenstine, Ph. D. Updated February 04, 2018Chemical and physical changes are related to chemical and physical properties. Chemical Changes Chemical changes take place on the molecular level. A chemical change produces a new substance. Another way to think of it is that a chemical change accompanies a chemical reaction. Examples of chemical changes include combustion (burning), cooking an egg, rusting of an iron pan, and mixing hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide to make salt and water. Physical Changes Physical changes are concerned with energy and states of matter. A physical change does not produce a new substance, although the starting and ending materials may look very different from each other. Changes in state or phase (melting, freezing, vaporization, condensation, sublimation) are physical changes. Examples of physical changes include crushing a can, melting an ice cube, and breaking a bottle. How to Tell Chemical & Physical Changes Apart A chemical change makes a substance that wasn't there before. There may be clues that a chemical reaction took places, such as light, heat, color change, gas production, odor, or sound. The starting and ending materials of a physical change are the same, even though they may look different.

    "What Do Physician Assistant Do on a Daily Basis? October 16, 2013 Physician Assistant 4,462 Views THE ROLE OF THE PHYSICIAN ASSISTANTThe Physician Assistant – A Vital Extension of Physician Care For 50 years, qualified medical specialists called Physician Assistants (PA) have been called upon to execute routine tasks generally performed by doctors. They conduct physical examinations, diagnosis and treat illnesses, perform procedures, assist physicians in surgery, determine which laboratory tests are necessary, interpret laboratory tests, and often visit patients in hospitals and rehabilitation facilities. The role of the PA is recognized by every state in America. The PA fills the gap between physicians and the nursing staff, practicing medical procedures strictly defined and regulated by accreditation and licensure. Each state has specific requirements, but in general, the PA is certified to the same high standards as physicians. Physicians and physician assistants work together as a team. Specific duties are delegated to the PA by the supervising physician and the PA is expected to carry out these assignments autonomously. The physician may or may not be present as the PA goes about these duties. The training and and education of the PA is similar to that required for physicians, and the physician relies upon the diagnostic and therapeutic knowledge and skills of the PA as an efficient method of extending medical care to a greater number of patients. TASKS PERFORMED BY PHYSICIAN ASSISTANTSWhat Do Physician Assistant Do? Patient Interaction It is customary for the physician assistant to perform all preliminary patient interactions. The PA consults with patients to identify their immediate and long-term patient care issues, reviews their medical history, and assesses treatment options and courses of action. The PA then discusses observations, deliberations, and recommendations for treatment with the supervising physician. The efficiency of the physician is greatly aided by the tasks performed by the PA which include: Start your career now!Get information from local schools Area of Interest Program Campus Online Both Zip Code• Patient interviews • Obtaining patient medical histories • Physical examinations • Recording patient care services • Preparing medical charts Patient Treatment To increase the efficiency and quality of patient care, many diagnostic and curative procedures are performed by the PA at the direction of a supervising physician.• The physician assistant examines patients and determines any abnormal conditions or anomalies. o Administers or orders diagnostic tests and interprets test results o X-rays, MRI, Cat Scan o Electrocardiograms o Laboratory studies • Performs therapeutic procedures • Administers injections and immunizations • Cleaning, dressing and suturing wounds and infections • Administers non-invasive medical diagnostic tests Patient Advice The PA prescribes therapeutic treatment and advises and counsels patients, discusses any chronic conditions, outlines possible outcomes of treatment, and interprets medical terms for patients and their families. These interactions are important to improve patient healthcare education, and to promote wellness and healthy lifestyle choices. Patient healthcare management plans are developed by the physician assistant to provide individually tailored continuity of care for patients. Administrative Duties The physician assistant handles many of the administrative duties of a medical clinic or office. These duties may include any or all of the following responsibilities:• Oversee regulatory compliance to ensure a safe and clean working environment. • Manage infectious disease control policies, procedures and protocols. • Develop healthcare team and coordinate technical information, educational programs and growth opportunities for staff members. • Maintain records and certifications to comply with laws, regulations, and license requirements.
